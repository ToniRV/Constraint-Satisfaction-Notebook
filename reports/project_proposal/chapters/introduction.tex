\chapter{Project Proposal}\label{sec:project_proposal}

We will explain in this document the fundamentals of Constraint Satisfaction Problems following the notes and content presented in MIT's 16.413 course on Principles of Autonomy for Decision Making.

In particular, we will explain the following topics in an interactive way by focusing on solving the well-known Sudoku problem in different ways, while comparing the benefits and disadvantages of the different approaches:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Constraint Propagation:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item AC-1
      \item AC-3
    \end{itemize}
  \item Backtracking:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Forward checking
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Finally, we will extend the provided course content by presenting the \textbf{MAC algorithm} (Maintaining Arc Consistency) which improves the forward checking algorithm that we will learn in class.
The basic idea is that MAC propagates constraints recursevely when changes are made to the domains of variables.
We will also discuss advances on the original MAC algorithm \cite{Chavalit2004mac}
