    "\n",
    "#### Formulating CSPs as a state space search problem\n",
    "\n",
    "CSPs can be formulated using the State Space search representation.\n",
    "In particular, we can express a CSP as follows:\n",
    "* **State**:\n",
    "    - We can define as state a **partial assignment** to variables made thus far.\n",
    "    For example, if we have variables $A$, $B$ and $C$ whith respective domains $[a_1, a_2]$, $[b_1, b_2]$, and  $[c_1, c_2]$ a partial assignment would be for example $\\{A=a_2, C=c_1\\}$, another one could be $\\{B=b_2, C=c_2\\}$. In contrast, we consider a **complete assignment** one where all variables would be assigned, such as $\\{A=a_2, B=b_1, C=c_1\\}$. Note that a complete assignment is still a (kind-of) partial assignment.\n",
    "* **Initial State**:\n",
    "    - Initially the state would be **no assignment**, which we can represent as the empty set $\\{\\}$.\n",
    "* **Operator**:\n",
    "    - We also need to define an action/operator to frame a CSP into a State Space search problem.\n",
    "    In our case, this would correspond to the fact of **adding a new assignment**.\n",
    "    In other words, our operator corresponds to the action of assigning a value to a yet unassigned variable $X=x$, which expands the State by one element. For example, if we start from the initial state $\\{\\}$, and we proceed with the action $X=x,$ we end up with a new state $\\{X=x\\}$, which is itself a partial assignment.\n",
    "* **Goal Test**:\n",
    "    - As in all State Space search problems, we need to define what is our goal state.\n",
    "    In our case, this is achieved when all variables are assigned (meaning we have a **complete assignment**) and all constraints are satisfied (which we refer to as a **consistent assignment**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the problem is formulated as a State Space search problem, we can use standard search algorithms such as:\n",
    "* Breadth first search\n",
    "* Depth first search\n",
    "* Depth-limited search\n",
    "\n",
    "to solve the given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, given a CSP with $n$ variables with a domain size of $d$, results in a branching factor at the top level of $nd$.\n",
    "This is because any of the $n$ variables can be assigned any of $d$ values.\n",
    "Once a variable has been assigned a value, we are still left with $n − 1$ variables which can be assigned $d$ values. By induction, we end up with a tree having $n!d^n ∼ O((nd)^n)$ leaves, which is even larger than the possible $d^n$ complete assignments!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we can observe than in a CSP **the order when assigning variables does not influence the solution**. This property is known as **commutativity**. More specifically, a problem is commutative if the order of application of any given set of actions does no effect on the outcome. Therefore, there is no need to consider all variables at each level of the search tree, but just one at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense intuitvely, for example, if we consider the coloring map problem, we might decide whether to color a certain region red or blue, but we would not decide between coloring one region red or another region blue. Therefore, the number of leaves is reduced to $d^n$, where we just have to decide on an assignment for each variable at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: NQueens with generic search (5 Queens)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us apply a generic search algorithm to the NQueens problem.\n",

    "Backtracking search suits the commutative property of CSPs, as it consists on a depth-first search that chooses one variable at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it makes use of another property of CSPs that is **extensions to inconsistent partial assignments are always inconsistent**.\n",
    "The backtracking search **backtracks** when an inconsistent partial assignment is reached. \n",

    "solution. If it is not consistent, then the algorithm backtracks by trying with another value instead.\n",

    "    - Every time a variable has been assigned a value, there is the opportunity to further reduce the domains of the rest of unassigned variables using inference, such as checking for arcconsistency. While the call to this function is not strictly necessary, we will see in section 2.3.3 that interleaving search and inference results in a more efficient algorithm.\n",
