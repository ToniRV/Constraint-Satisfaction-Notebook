## Installation
Heavily recommended to use a virtual environment to use this setup.
You can do that by for example using virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper.

Install pip:

If in Mac, do (assuming you installed brew, which you should...):
```
brew install pip
```

If in Linux:
```
sudo apt-get install pip
```

Install virtualenv:
```
pip install virtualenv
```

Install virtualenvwrapper:
```
pip install virtualenvwrapper
```

Now, let's clone this repo and install the necessary requirements.
```
git clone git@github.com:ToniRV/Constraint-Satisfaction-Notebook.git csp_notebook
```
Or if you don't want to use SSH or you don't have it setup:
```
git clone https://github.com/ToniRV/Constraint-Satisfaction-Notebook.git csp_notebook
```

cd csp_notebook
mkvirtualenv csp_notebook --python=/usr/local/bin/python3 -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, activate your virtual environment:
```
workon csp_notebook
```

You are ready to go!
